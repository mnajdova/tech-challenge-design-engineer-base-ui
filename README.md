# Design Engineer technical challenge @ MUI

This challenge is part of the hiring process for some positions at MUI.
The idea is to make as much progress as possible under a given time constraint of (3-4 hours).

## Why are we doing this?

At MUI, because we are a DevTools company, you'll make product decisions.
You will flesh out product requirements and turn them into a technical design and implementation.
This challenge simulates that, we will review the product decisions you make, the quality of the code, and the design of the UI.
We want to get a glimpse of how you will perform in the role.

## Context about MUI

MUI's objective is to become the UI toolkit for React developers.
We're unifying the fragmented ecosystem of dependencies into a single set of simple, beautiful, consistent, and accessible React components.

Our mission is, ultimately, to make building great UIs and web apps a breeze âŽ¯ quicker, simpler, and accessible to more people.
At the end of the day, it's about [_writing less code_](https://youtu.be/GnO7D5UaDig?t=2451).

## The challenge

Given that the Design Engineer position sits right at the intersection between engineering and design, this challenge aims to simulate how a potential day-to-day situation plays out.
Our challenge is to **build a simplified version of a Combo Box**.
We'll review how you make design and API decisions and the quality of the written code.

### Introduction

A Combo Box is a component that combines a _text box_ with a _dropdown list_, allowing the users to choose among a long list of mutually exclusive values. For instance, Chrome's URL bar:

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/combo-box-dark.png">
  <img alt="" src="/combo-box.png" height="100%">
</picture>

### Objective

The goal of this challenge is to implement the above component:

- [ ] no high-level primitives, e.g. without [`<datalist>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist), without pre-made React components
- [ ] reproduce as much of the UX of Chrome's URL bar as possible. You can also benchmark with the UX of Google's main search bar to adjust the tradeoffs. The end goal is to be able to use the component for the same search use case.
- [ ] use React hooks, no class components
- [ ] be written in TypeScript, `any` and `@ts-ignore` are accepted but need to be justified (comments)
- [ ] be performant, it can render 300 options without virtualization
- [ ] be accessible, end-users could only use the keyboard, see [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/) for guidance. Their [examples](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/combobox/combobox-autocomplete-both.html) might be the most helpful.
- [ ] looks great, has a beautiful UI
- [ ] make the existing test pass, add tests for edge cases
- [ ] has no linting errors (`yarn prettier && yarn eslint && yarn typescript`)
- [ ] has an ergonomic API

In practice, such a solution would require dozens of hours to reach the high-quality bar we expect MUI components to have (if not > 100 hours). To keep the challenge short, we will focus on solving a subset of the problem:

- you may drop behaviors that have a too high time opportunity cost. Please **document the behaviors you drop and why**.
- don't write documentation but enough to see how to use the component, e.g. one demo.
- only one browser support (of your choice)
- no touch screen support
- no dark mode support
- no right-to-left support
- no npm publish

We encourage you to add your creative spin to the designâ€”we want to see your design taste!

### Work environment

To save you time, we created a working environment with Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, and other complementary dependencies.
Follow the steps:

- Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:mui/tech-challenge-design-engineer.git`
- Install the dependencies: `pnpm i`
- Start Next.js: `pnpm dev`
- Open http://0.0.0.0:3002/

## Submission

Instructions:

- **DO NOT** fork / host your project on a public repository.
- Please send us a zip file containing this project using the upload link that we have provided by email (**with** the _.git_ folder).
- To significantly reduce the size of the archive, remove the `/_node_modules_/` and `/.next/` folders.
- If you don't have the upload link, you can send it to job@mui.com.

We're excited and looking forward to seeing what you'll create!
Good luck ðŸš€
